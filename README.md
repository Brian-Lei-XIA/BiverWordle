# BiverWordle: A Visualization System for Analyzing Stock Market Sentiments in Financial Text Forums

## Overview

BiverWordle is a novel visualization system for analyzing, visualizing, and verifying the sentiments of stock trends on financial text forums. It combines stock data visualization techniques, such as K-Line diagrams, with text data visualization methods like Theme River and Word Cloud, to provide a comprehensive and intuitive representation of stock market sentiment.

## Key Features

- Integration of multiple visualization techniques for a comprehensive understanding of stock market sentiment.
- Analysis of Chinese financial text data to understand and visualize market trends.
- Validation of our system using three different stock trend scenarios.
- Exploration of potential improvements in both the financial text classification and visualization aspects of the project.

## System Components

- **Text Classification**: BiverWordle employs text classification algorithms, such as textCNN and BERT, to analyze and categorize financial text data from forums.
- **Visualization**: BiverWordle combines various visualization techniques, including K-Line diagrams, Theme River, and Word Cloud, to represent stock trends and sentiments.

## Future Improvements

We plan to further enhance our system by:
- Employing specialist annotators to redefine tag categories and provide specialized data tagging.
- Exploring additional classification methods and experimenting with new sentiment analysis algorithms.
- Building a financial category-specific corpus for sentiment analysis.
- Integrating new visualization techniques and advanced features to improve the overall effectiveness and intuitiveness of our system.
